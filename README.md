### <a id="tutorial">• How To Play</a>
You play by moving into blocks and pushing them around with your arrow / WASD keys.

Pushing certain blocks into others will create combinations, granting you different types of blocks.

Just like the game this world is hosted on, there isn't really a set goal to accomplish, so feel free to do whatever you'd like.
Some things you can try are unlocking all block combinations, creating art, or advancing up the points leaderboard.

• All usable commands are listed in [Commands](Commands.md).\
• All possible block combinations are listed in [Block Combinations](Combinations.md). Some combinations may require purchasing in the shop or through unlocking by playing.\
• All purchasable items, powerups and block combinations are listed in [Shop](Shop.md)

(Note, not everything listed may be available and also is subject to change)
