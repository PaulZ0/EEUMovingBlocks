### <a id="how-to-play">â€¢ How To Play</a>
You play by moving into blocks and pushing them around. 
Pushing certain blocks into others will create combinations, granting you different types of blocks.
Just like the game this world is hosted on, there isn't really a set goal to accomplish, so feel free to do whatever you'd like.
Some things you can try are unlocking all block combinations, creating art, working up your way on the points leaderboard.

(Note, not everything listed may be available)
