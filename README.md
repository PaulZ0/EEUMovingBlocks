### <a id="tutorial">• How To Play</a>
You play by moving into blocks and pushing them around. 
Pushing certain blocks into others will create combinations, granting you different types of blocks.
Just like the game this world is hosted on, there isn't really a set goal to accomplish, so feel free to do whatever you'd like.
Some things you can try are unlocking all block combinations, creating art, working up your way on the points leaderboard.

• All usable commands are listed in [Commands](Commands.md).\
• All possible block combinations are listed in [Block Combinations](Combinations.md). Some combinations may require purchasing in the shop or through unlocking by playing.\
• All purchasable items, powerups and block combinations are listed in [Shop](Shop.md)

(Note, not everything listed may be available and also is subject to change)
